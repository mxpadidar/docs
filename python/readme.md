## RESTful API Definition

A RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It allows clients to access and manipulate resources using a set of predefined operations. RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request.

The key principles of RESTful APIs include:

- **Resources**: Represented as URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), resources are the key abstraction in RESTful APIs. Each resource should have a unique URI.

- **HTTP Methods**: RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. For example, GET retrieves a resource, POST creates a new resource, PUT updates an existing resource, and DELETE removes a resource.

- **Stateless Communication**: RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.

- **Representation**: Resources are represented in a specific format, such as JSON or XML. Clients can request different representations of a resource using content negotiation.

- **Hypermedia**: RESTful APIs use hypermedia links to navigate between resources. Hypermedia links provide a way for clients to discover and interact with related resources.
