# **Struct in Go**

## **Basic Syntax**

To define and use a struct in Go:

```go
// Define a struct
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

// Create a new instance using a struct literal
p := Person{
    Name: "Alice",
    Age:  30,
}

// Create a new instance using the 'new' keyword
p := new(Person) // Returns a pointer to a Person
p.Name = "Alice"
p.Age = 30

// Create a new instance using a struct literal and take its address
p := &Person{
    Name: "Alice",
    Age:  30,
}

// Access and modify fields using dot notation
fmt.Println(p.Name) // Output: Alice
p.Age = 31          // Modify the Age field
```

## **Struct Composition**

Composition allows you to create new types by embedding existing structs. It is Goâ€™s way of achieving a form of inheritance.

```go
type Address struct {
    City    string
    ZipCode string
}

type Employee struct {
    Person
    Address
    EmployeeID int
}

e := Employee{
    Person: Person{
        Name: "Bob",
        Age:  25,
    },
    Address: Address{
        City:    "New York",
        ZipCode: "10001",
    },
    EmployeeID: 12345,
}

// Access embedded struct fields directly
fmt.Println(e.Name)    // Output: Bob
fmt.Println(e.City)    // Output: New York
fmt.Println(e.Address) // Output: {New York 10001}
```

## **Struct Constructors**

Go does not have explicit constructors, but you can create factory functions to initialize structs:

```go
func NewPerson(name string, age int) *Person {
    return &Person{
        Name: name,
        Age:  age,
    }
}

p := NewPerson("Alice", 30)
fmt.Println(p.Name) // Output: Alice
```

---

## **Struct Methods**

Methods in Go are functions with a receiver, which is a reference to the struct. Receivers can be either by value or by pointer:

- **Pointer receiver**: Use this when you want to modify the original struct or avoid copying large structs.
- **Value receiver**: Use this for small structs when you don't need to modify the original.

```go
// Method with a pointer receiver
func (p *Person) Greet() string {
    return "Hello, my name is " + p.Name
}

// Method with a value receiver
func (p Person) IsAdult() bool {
    return p.Age >= 18
}

p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
fmt.Println(p.Greet())   // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
fmt.Println(p.IsAdult()) // Output: true
```

---

## **Struct Embedding in Go**

**Struct embedding** is a feature in Go that allows one struct to include another struct. This promotes code reuse and composition, enabling the embedding struct to access fields and methods of the embedded struct as if they were its own.

Go emphasizes composition rather than classical inheritance, and struct embedding is a key tool for this.

- The fields and methods of the embedded struct are promoted to the embedding struct.

- If both the embedding and embedded structs have fields or methods with the same name, explicit access via the embedded struct's name is required.

```go
type Person struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
}
type Logger struct{}

func (l Logger) Log(message string) {
    fmt.Println("Log:", message)
}


type Employee struct {
    ID int
    Name string
    Person
    Logger
}

employee := Employee{
    ID: 1,
    Name: "Alice",
    Person: Person{
        Name: "Alice",
        Age:  30,
    },
    Logger: Logger{},
}

employee.log(employee.Name) // Name of the employee struct itself
employee.log(employee.Person.Name) // Name of the embedded Person struct, just can be accessed by Person
employee.log(employee.Age) // can be accessed directly by the employee struct
```

## **Tags in Struct Fields**

Struct fields can have tags, which are string metadata often used in tasks like encoding/decoding (e.g., JSON, XML). Tags are accessed via reflection.

```go
type User struct {
    ID    int    `json:"id"`
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Email string `json:"email"`
}

u := User{
    ID:    1,
    Name:  "John Doe",
    Email: "john@example.com",
}

// Encode struct to JSON
data, _ := json.Marshal(u)
fmt.Println(string(data)) // Output: {"id":1,"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com"}
```

## **Anonymous Structs**

Go supports anonymous structs, useful for one-off data structures:

```go
p := struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}{
    Name: "Alice",
    Age:  30,
}

fmt.Println(p.Name) // Output: Alice
```

## **Comparing Structs**

Structs in Go can be compared using the `==` and `!=` operators. Two structs are equal if all their fields are equal:

```go
p1 := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
p2 := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}

fmt.Println(p1 == p2) // Output: true
```

### Note

- Only comparable fields (e.g., numbers, strings, or other comparable structs) can be compared.
- Structs with slice, map, or function fields cannot be directly compared.

## **Copying Structs**

Assigning a struct creates a copy. Modifications to the new struct do not affect the original:

```go
p1 := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
p2 := p1

p2.Age = 31
fmt.Println(p1.Age) // Output: 30
fmt.Println(p2.Age) // Output: 31
```

Use pointers to share data between structs:

```go
p1 := &Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
p2 := p1
p2.Age = 31

fmt.Println(p1.Age) // Output: 31
```

## **Zero Value of Structs**

The zero value of a struct is a struct with all its fields set to their zero values:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

var p Person
fmt.Println(p) // Output: { 0}
```

## **Best Practices**

1. **Use pointers** when you need to modify struct fields or avoid copying large structs.
2. **Avoid embedding large structs**; use pointers instead for better performance.
3. **Leverage tags** for encoding, validation, or metadata.
4. **Prefer constructors** for initializing complex structs.
5. **Use composition** to share common fields across structs without resorting to inheritance.
