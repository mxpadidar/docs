# REST vs. RESTful: The Difference and Why the Difference Doesn’t Matter

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It’s an architectural pattern for creating web services. A RESTful service is one that implements that pattern. In other words, REST is a set of guidelines for building web services, while RESTful is a term used to describe services that follow those guidelines.

## REST Definition

**Client-server** – REST applications have a server that manages application data and state. The server communicates with a client that handles the user interactions. A clear separation of concerns divides the two components. This means you can update and improve them in independent tracks.

**Stateless** – servers don’t maintain any client state. Clients manage their application state. Their requests to servers contain all the information required to process them.

**Cacheable** – servers must mark their responses as cacheable or not. So, infrastructures and clients can cache them when possible to improve performance. They can dispose of non-cacheable information, so no client uses stale data.

**Uniform interface** – The uniform interface ensures that once you learn how to interact with one RESTful service, you can interact with any other RESTful service in the same way.

Each resource in a RESTful service is identified by a unique URI and can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Resources are represented in a specific format, such as JSON or XML. Clients can request different representations of a resource using content negotiation.

**Layered system** – components in the system cannot “see” beyond their layer. So, you can easily add load-balancers and proxies to improve security or performance.

## gRPC Overview

**gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)** is a modern, high-performance framework for building RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services. It allows clients to directly invoke methods on a server application as if it were a local object, enabling efficient communication between distributed systems.

**Key Features:**

- **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf):** gRPC uses Protobuf, a language-neutral and platform-neutral serialization mechanism, for defining service contracts and serializing structured data efficiently.
- **Bidirectional Streaming:** gRPC supports real-time communication via streaming, allowing clients and servers to send multiple messages in a single connection.
- **HTTP/2:** gRPC is built on HTTP/2, providing multiplexing, flow control, and lower latency compared to HTTP/1.1.
- **Multi-language Support:** gRPC supports many programming languages, enabling cross-platform development.
- **Strongly Typed APIs:** Contracts are explicitly defined, reducing ambiguity and enabling better tooling and code generation.

**Use Cases:**

- Microservices communication
- Real-time data processing
- High-performance APIs in latency-sensitive systems

## GraphQL Overview

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries. It provides clients with the flexibility to request only the data they need, improving efficiency and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

**Key Features:**

- **Single Endpoint:** Unlike REST, which often has multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL uses a single endpoint to handle all queries and mutations.
- **Client-Driven Queries:** Clients define the structure of the data they want. This makes APIs more flexible and reduces unnecessary data transfer.
- **Strongly Typed Schema:** The GraphQL schema defines the types and relationships of the data, ensuring clear documentation and enabling tools like auto-completion and validation.
- **Real-Time Updates:** GraphQL subscriptions enable real-time communication, allowing clients to receive updates when data changes.

**Use Cases:**

- Mobile and web applications requiring tailored data responses
- Complex APIs with interconnected data
- Scenarios with diverse client requirements

### REST vs. gRPC vs. GraphQL

| Feature               | REST            | gRPC                         | GraphQL              |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Transport**         | HTTP/1.1        | HTTP/2                       | HTTP/1.1             |
| **Data Format**       | JSON, XML       | Protobuf                     | JSON                 |
| **Query Flexibility** | Fixed Endpoints | Fixed Endpoints              | Dynamic Queries      |
| **Performance**       | Moderate        | High (binary protocol)       | Moderate             |
| **Real-Time Support** | Limited         | Excellent (streaming)        | Good (subscriptions) |
| **Ease of Use**       | High            | Moderate (requires Protobuf) | High                 |

Each approach has its strengths, and the choice depends on the specific needs of the application, such as performance requirements, developer experience, and use case complexity.
